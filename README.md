## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://digiseller.mycdn.ink/preview/807251/p1_3985108_9e0e9834.jpg)

I'm creating a game in the Hero Siege genre. In it, you will have to fight against hordes of enemies, while upgrading your weapons and skills.
With each new wave, the opponents are getting stronger, so you need to choose improvements wisely, creating a unique build to suit your style of play.

The game features: 
- Movement on the map
- Battles with opponents
- Character progression. 

In future updates, it is planned to add new levels, more challenging and interesting opponents, unique customization and leaderboard!

### Built With

Here are some libraries, modules and sprite templates which I am using:
- [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [itch.io](https://itch.io/)
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)

## Getting Started
